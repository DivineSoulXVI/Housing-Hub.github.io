        <h3> 2. Have your paperwork ready</h3>
        <p>Make sure that you have all the necessary paperwork organized for a smooth transition to the country! This includes your passport, student visa, and acceptance letter from the university you're attending. Keep copies of important documents both digitally and physically, so that you'll always have them ready in case you need them. Familiarize yourself with the local administrative procedures to make sure you won't run into any avoidable complications during your stay here. Got any questions about any paperwork-related matter? Take a look at <a href="https://www.studyinnl.org/life-in-nl/to-do-after-arrival">this</a> webpage which provides more information. </p>

        <h3>3. Register for a doctor</h3>
        <p>Upon arrival, make sure to register with a local GP (general practitioner) or doctor. This is crucial for getting access to healthcare services in the Netherlands. Research doctors in your area and find out what the process is for making appointments. Having a registered doctor will be beneficial in case you need medical assistance during your stay. Keep your health insurance information and any other important health related information readily available. Tell your new doctor all the relevant information about any pre-existing health conditions or concerns. Don't have a health insurance yet? Visit <a href="https://www.studyinnl.org/plan-your-stay/insurance">this</a> website for more information.</p>

        <h3> 4. Get a bike</h3>
        <p>Invest in a bike! You don't have to spend much money on a bike, look into getting a second hand bike on marktplaats.nl or Facebook Marketplace. A new bike costs between 100 and 300 euro while a second hand bike usually costs between 50 and 100 euro. Make sure your bike has a proper lock and working lights. If you don't have working lights while riding your bike in the dark, the police can give you a fine of 60 euro. It's also important to know that if you get caught with a phone in your hand while riding a bike, you can receive a fine of 159 euro.</p>

    <div class="tipbox tip5">
        <h3>5. Apply for DUO</h3>
        <p>If you meet the eligibility criteria, consider applying for financial assistance from DUO (Dienst Uitvoering Onderwijs). DUO provides financial support, such as student loans and grants. Familiarize yourself with the application process and deadlines to ensure you receive any financial support you may be entitled to. It also comes in very handy to get Studenten OV, which is a (essentially) free public transport card for students. Make sure you understand the terms and conditions of any support provided by DUO. Go to their <a href="https://duo.nl/particulier/student-finance/">official website</a> to learn more about the amounts, eligibility and how to apply.</p>

        <h3> 6. Create a monthly budget</h3>
        <p>Create a realistic monthly budget that includes your accommodation, utilities, groceries, transportation, and other living expenses. Also make sure to factor in entertainment activities and emergencies. Make sure to stick to your monthly budget to avoid any financial complications in the future. The average student spends around 800 to 1100 euro a month. Also look into exploring student discounts: apps such as Knaek and StudentBeans offer student discounts on food, clothing, activities and lots of other things! A lot of stores offer online and in-person student discounts as well. </p>
